# The Challenge üéØ: Financial Articles Search Engine

This project consisted in building a search engine for a large collection of financial news articles from Jan - May 2018.
The dataset contains more than 300,000 JSON-formatted articles.

The full dataset (compressed) is about 1.3 GB and is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jeet2016/us-financial-news-articles).
For testing purposes we used the following sample [dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ugn3mzgy2ogyqwu/sample_data_sets.zip?dl=0),
available on Dropbox.

# Our solution
Our solution is a Command Line Interface(CLI) application, and presents itself as follows:
![Search engine main UI](./etc/main-menu.png)

_**Note**: Our team was not able to implement the persistent file functionality. Consequently, Options 1 and 2
do not work._

# Dependencies, Tools, or Frameworks üõ†Ô∏è

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/): To compile the project.
- [thread library](https://github.com/progschj/ThreadPool): To distribute work to the available compute cores on our different machines.
- [Stemming library](https://github.com/smassung/porter2_stemmer): For stemming words the search engine will index.

# How to run the project?
To run the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kassi-bertrand/googlyeyes-search-engine.git
```
2. Get into the project folder:
```shell
cd googlyeyes-search-engine
```
3. Create a `test` folder and cd into it:
```shell
mkdir test && cd test
```
4. Build and compile the project from the `test` folder:
```shell
cmake .. && make
```
5. Run the program executable:
```shell
./22s_final_proj
```

# How to use the search engine? üîç

Before performing any search, the program must parse (see performance below) the entire dataset 
and index keywords within the articles. 

To allow the user to search the corpus, we implemented a **_boolean query processor_**. This
query processor has the following properties:

- The Boolean expression will be prefixed with a Boolean operator of either AND or OR if there is more than one word of interest.
- No query will contain both AND and OR.
- Single word queries (not counting NOT or additional operators below) do not need a boolean operator.
- Trailing search terms may be preceded with the NOT operator, which indicates articles containing that term should be removed from the result set.
- Additional Operators: A query can contain zero or more of the following:
  - ORG <some organization name> - the org operator will search a special index you maintain related to organizations mentioned in the entity metadata
  - PERSON <some person name> - the person operator will search a special index you maintain related to persons mentioned in the article‚Äôs entity metadata.
  - Additional Operator Notes:
    - the order of ORG or PERSON doesn‚Äôt matter (meaning, you should accept queries that have them in either order)
    - the operators will always be entered in all caps.
    - you may assume that neither ORG nor PERSON will be search terms themselves.

Here are some examples:
- **markets**
  - This query should return all articles that contain the word _markets_.
- **AND social network**
  - This query should return all articles that contain the words ‚Äúsocial‚Äù and ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù (doesn‚Äôt have to be as a 2-word phrase)
- **AND social network PERSON cramer**
  - This query should return all articles that contain the words social and network and that mention cramer as a person entity.
- **AND social network ORG facebook PERSON cramer**
  - This query should return all articles that contain the words social and network, that have an entity organization 
  of facebook and that mention cramer as a person entity.
- **OR snap facebook**
  - This query should return all articles that contain either _snap_ OR _facebook_
- **OR facebook meta NOT profits**
  - This query should return all articles that contain facebook or meta but that do not contain the word profits.
- **bankruptcy NOT facebook**
  - This query should return all articles that contain bankruptcy, but not facebook.
- **OR facebook instagram NOT bankruptcy ORG snap PERSON cramer**
  - This query should return any article that contains the word facebook OR instagram but that does NOT contain 
  the word bankruptcy, and the article should have an organization entity with Snap and a person entity of cramer
  
## Parsing speed Results
Our implementation leverages the CPU threads to keep processing cores as busy as possible. As result, parsing
took significantly less time, here is some performance data:

| Dataset size | 10    | 221   | 6,000 | 300,000 |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Time(s)      | < 1   | < 1   | 2.78  | 43 - 60 | 

_**Note**: Performance data differed from my machine to my partner's. His machine is faster than mine. So depending on your
machine, you might get different results._

# Coding Conventions

For this project, the team adopted the following conventions to facilitate collaboration:

- ***variable and function names***

Variables and functions name shall follow the *snake case* naming style.
```c++
int variable_name;
int function_name();
```
- ***Class declaration comments***

Class declarations shall be preceded by the following comment:
```c++
/**
 * @Author(s): 
 * @filename: 
 * @date: mm-dd-yyyy
 * @description: 
 */
```
- ***Avoid global namespaces***

Using global namespaces is strictly forbidden.

**NO** ‚ùå
```c++
using namespace std;
cout << "Hello world" << endl;
```

**YES** ‚úîÔ∏è
```c++
std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;
```

- ***Short commit messages***

Commit messages must be relatively short. Ideally, must do **ONE** thing at a time. Example:

```shell
git commit -m 'Implemented member function X from Class Y'
or
git commit -m 'Fixed seg fault in function Z'
```

- ***Function declaration comments***

function declarations shall be preceded by the following comment:
```c++
    /// \param              -> 
    /// \return             -> 
    /// \description        -> 
```

Example:
```c++
    ///
    /// \param folder       -> Path to a folder withing the filesystem
    /// \return Vector      -> A set of processed JSON (Article objects)
    /// \description        -> Call "parse_json" on EACH JSON file within "folder"
    static std::vector<Article> parse_folder(const std::filesystem::directory_entry &folder);
```
